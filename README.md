## Project Description

MentalQ is a mobile application designed to detect a user's mental state by analyzing and processing their daily notes. Many people struggle to understand and address their mental well-being due to a lack of self-awareness and accessible, reliable tools for self-assessment. MentalQ tackles this problem by providing users with a clear, personalized understanding of their emotional health based on their daily reflections. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, the application interprets written content to identify underlying emotions, stress levels, and mental health patterns.
